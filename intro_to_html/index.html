    <h2>Memphis BBQ</h2>

    <p>As a Southern, there's no surprise as to why BBQ is first up on the list. If you're a BBQ lover like me than Memphis is the place to be because pulled pork sandwhiches are a must try when visiting Memphis. The flavor from the dry rub and smokiness from the hickory wood is what gives its distinct taste. This masterpiece is ypically served with cole slaw on the sandwhich with a side of delicious baked beans. I'd totally understand if your mouth is watering right now. And if you're thinking, "I can't wait I need that sandwhich now!" No worries, I got you. Click "Memphis BBQ" to get the recipe. You're welcome.</p>
