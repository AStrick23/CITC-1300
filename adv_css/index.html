                <hr>
                <p>
                    During the first years of the Great Depression on October 24,1932, entrepreneur Rody Davenport Jr.
                    and partner J. Glenn Sherrill theorized that even in a severe economic upheaval, "People would
                    patronize a restaurant that was kept spotlessly clean, where they could get a good meal with
                    courteous service at the lowest possible price." Davenport's wife, Mary, came up with the
                    restaurant's name after noticing how clean a crystal ball lawn ornament was. Davenport and Sherrill
                    were sticklers for cleanliness, so "crystal clean" or "clean as a crystal" came to mind.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Did you know that McKee Foods, also know as Little Debbie, was founded during the Great Deppression?
                    That's right. In 1934 O.D.
                    McKee and his wife Ruth bought a small bakery from Jack's Cookie Company in Chattanooga, TN where
                    they baked small cakes. They started off by selling Virginia Dare cakes in the backseat of O.D's car
                    in 1928. After selling the company and buying it back years later, McKee Baking Company turned into
                    Mckee Foods Coorporation. McKee Foods Corporation sells over 900 million cartons of snacks each
                    year.</p>

                <h3>MoonPies</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    MoonPies were created in 1917 at a bakery in
                    Chattanooga, TN. Earl Mitchell is credited with the invention of MoonPies but there's a couple of
                    others
                    who are to thank. Eric Mitchell was a traveling salesman who encountered a
                    coal miner that gave him his million dollar idea. Mitchell reported this request back to the
                    bakery
                    who fulfilled his wishes. Thus the
                    MoonPie was born.
