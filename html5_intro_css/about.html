        <h2>About MoonPies</h2>
        <p>MoonPies were created in 1917 at a bakery in
            Chattanooga, TN. Earl Mitchell is credited with the invention of MoonPies but there's a couple of others
            who are to thank. Eric Mitchell was a traveling salesman who encountered a
            coal miner that asked for a snack "as big as the moon." Mitchell reported this request back to the
            bakery
            who fulfilled his wishes and thus the
            MoonPie was born.</p>
