            <h2>Y2K Fashion</h2>
            <hr>

            <p>Y2K fashion often features bold, playful, and experimental styles. This includes trends such as low-rise
                jeans, crop tops, mini skirts, cargo pants, platform shoes, butterfly clips, and chunky sneakers. Bright
                colors, metallic fabrics, and iridescent materials are also characteristic of Y2K-inspired clothing.
                Casual clothing and leisurewear were the other big trends of the early 2000s. Denim became a staple for
                men and women, going beyond jeans to shirts, jackets, and hats. If you are putting together a casual
                style for women, think crop tops, hoodies, low-rise flared jeans, cargo pants, daisy dukes, jean skirts,
                off the shoulder tops, ribbed sweaters, with platform sandals, Ugg boots, or sneakers. </p>

            <p>Music influenced many fashion styles of the 2000s, with some fashion styles including hip-hop, indie,
                punk, and emo-inspired. Singers and actors that rose to fame in the 90s and 2000s especially were
                fashion icons who influenced most of the trends during this time. The people listed here were notorious
                for influencing the culture on to what to wear throughout the early 2000's.
            <p>The hip-hop culture was at an all-time high in the 2000s. So, fashion styles were influenced by hip-hop music. Wear baseball caps backwards, and add large, baggy t-shirts and sweatpants to the mix. You could also wear sports jerseys and shorts. During colder days, wear a large hoodie.</p>
