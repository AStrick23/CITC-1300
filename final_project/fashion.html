            <h2>Y2K Fashion</h2>
            <hr>

            <p>Y2K fashion often features bold, playful, and experimental styles. This includes trends such as low-rise
                jeans, crop tops, mini skirts, cargo pants, platform shoes, butterfly clips, and chunky sneakers. Bright
                colors, metallic fabrics, and iridescent materials are also characteristic of Y2K-inspired clothing.
                Casual clothing and leisurewear were the other big trends of the early 2000s. Denim became a staple for
                men and women, going beyond jeans to shirts, jackets, and hats. If you are putting together a casual
                style for women, think crop tops, hoodies, low-rise flared jeans, cargo pants, daisy dukes, jean skirts,
                off the shoulder tops, ribbed sweaters, with platform sandals, Ugg boots, or sneakers. </p>

            <h3>Hip-Hop Styles</h3>
            <p>Music influenced many fashion styles of the 2000s, with some fashion styles including hip-hop, indie,
                punk, and emo-inspired. Singers and actors that rose to fame in the 90s and 2000s especially were
                fashion icons who influenced most of the trends during this time. </p>
            <p>The hip-hop culture was at an all-time high in the 2000s. So, fashion styles were influenced by hip-hop
                music. Wear baseball caps backwards, and add large, baggy t-shirts and sweatpants to the mix. You could
                also wear sports jerseys and shorts. During colder days, wear a large hoodie.</p>
