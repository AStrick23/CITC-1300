            <h3>Why is Y2k Trendy?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p> Nostalgia often fuels trends, and as millennials and Gen Z individuals grow older, they tend to look
                back fondly on the cultural elements of their youth. The late 90s and early 2000s hold a special place
                in the hearts of many, and the Y2K trend allows people to reminisce about the music, fashion,
                technology, and pop culture of that era. So lets reminisce shall we? </p>
